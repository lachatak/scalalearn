## Spark with Scalaz ##
Recently I have had a little spare time to play around with [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). It promisses not less than a 100x faster computation than Hadoop MapReduce. I used to play with Spark, Akka, Camel setup within my [camel-spark](https://github.com/lachatak/camel-spark) project but now I wanted to use it together with Scalaz.
